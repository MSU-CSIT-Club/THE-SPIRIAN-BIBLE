Your Past, Present And Future All In One™ 
- The Spire icon also means the “I” of innovation (and means “king” in Chinese too)!   
____________  

S P I R I A N _ O U T L A W ™ The universal app for iPhone, Android and web browser. 
- The Spirian Outlaw icon is the [lower bottom of the normal Spire icon with a dot up top instead].   

GOAL: To get all of the things in our lives done. Really, really fast. This app eliminates the use of other task managing apps/paper agendas and puts them all in one place so that your tasks work with everyone's!  

MAIN FUNCTIONS: 
- GraphCalender™: the revolutionary calendar UI of the future. Your device will signal you when an event is minutes ahead, so you don’t need to check every time.  
- GraphShare™: Share your schedule with friends instantly. You can choose whether to show specifically what your up to at a specific point in time (“Naked”) or choose just to show "busy" at that point in time (“Personal”). 
- EventTabs™: filter your events with event tabs and find new event tabs in the tab store to add to your list to organize events you want to attend in the future. The main “Spire" icon [in the bottom left hand corner] shows all of your important events and more if you want it to show everything in your future (or past).  
- AppAbducter™: the system would "abduct" your Google, Facebook, and any other app events onto the your graph instantaneously (but it would ask for your permission first). 
- The today column is always static on the screen, so you can scroll to the future and still see today. 
- Selecting an event from an email, for example, will display information about it along with a hyperlink to the email / website affiliated with the date on your graph. 
- Websites that have isolated calendar events on their own will have the ability to all show up on your graph through a customizable tab. 
- HoloGrams™: the light-textured events that glow in the future on your graph. Holograms are inserted based on your interests and other data Spire has collected about you. You can hold down a hologram to stick it to your graph and let the app know you will be attending that event. 
- HeadLights™: the app knows you! Since you will be putting EVERY task and event on your graph, the app knows your habits and can know your next move! When it is time to do that daunting time consuming daily task again that can mess up your cramped schedule, the app will automatically shift around nearby events/tasks so you have enough time to do that one enjoying task, such as working on a research paper. This feature can help you manage your time to maximize daily production so you don't have to! (It will warn you when it changed something by notifying you. Once you open the app again, it will temporarily show you your OLD setup and then MOVE the events around live so you can see what it altered. You can choose to "keep" the changes or simply press “undo/leave"). 
- There is no such thing as white space! You are always doing something, so you are always going to see something on non-busy places on your graph (such as HoloGrams, assignments or possible tasks)! 
- Weekdays are permanently color coded: S = black. M = red. T = green. W = yellow. TH = blue. F = purple. SA = white.  
- Profile pictures are these 5x5 squares that you can mold and sculpt edges and corners to your liking. You can even make a picture collage. 
- Tasks and reminders are shown in a different part of the menu (or above your graph). Here you can simply check off or drag and drop a task onto your graph to give it a time.  

ADVANCED FUNCTIONS / AMENITIES: 
- There will be a light background picture that defines your mood and uses themes such as seasons. You can choose to decorate your background with as many decorations as you like. Ranging from icons, to colors, to textures, the background possibilities are endless. 
- Funny/humorous English dialogue system text (can be changed back in settings). 
- LifeLog™: to access your personal past events and app posts from friends, simply swipe to yesterday and type in your pin at the bottom of the screen (to see more than just your work stuff). Here you can access content such as Facebook status updates and tweets live on your own graph! 
- Swipe left or right on the calendar (in "week" form) to show the rest of the details of your events instead of having to manually tap it and see a separate box. 
- Drag the side of the screen quickly to view the "ribbon", which shows you a part of the future along with the today and tomorrow column (in “week” form). 
- Instead of scrolling, put thumb atop the SMTWTFS bar and slide it at a certain speed to scroll through specific far-away dates instantly. Pull your thumb all the way to the ends to rapidly scroll through months and years. It will show you "April, May, 2015, 2016" etc in the background so you know where your scrolling. 
- Other third party apps or companies can advertise events in your future (or wherever there is free time on your graph), which can lead to profit. 
- Chamfers™: the corners of each event on the graph that signify a specific type of event (eg. Diagonal = work related, and round = play related). 
- You can choose to turn on a tab that displays whenever a room of a building is open or when a office is free. - When having the Spire tab on, (and ALL of your other tabs selected), you will have an extremely cluttered graph (almost to the point of not being able to see your most important events)! To help with this, simply hold down the Spire tab* until you see a slide bar and then slide it left or right to overlap the mishmash of events to help select a specific one you need to see. Or you can [press some button] to view everything going on on the selected day on one super column. 
- There are 3 types of fonts used: a mathematically even system font (with diagonals and no curves), a perfectly circular font (normal text in menus), and retro 1920's font (for main/large text). The lines and UI are also 1920’s textured.  
- The whole app is also alien themed, so expect to see icons relating to UFOs and space what not. 
- Messages and other notifications show system boxes with a pixel blur effect instead of a fade-away.  
- The app is going to change a lot years down. That’s why there is a "switch between versions layout" button so you can view even the most recent updates in a previous, slightly altered older layout that has the look and feel of an older version. 
- would blur the start/end lines on an event that has no planned start/end times and just a time region

S P I R E _ S O C I E T Y ™ (or Spire Radon; there are a bunch of names in mind) 
The overlaying OS for iPhone, Android and the Spire device lineup. It does everything in Spirian Outlaw and a ton more!  

SYSTEM FUNCTIONS: 
- The Anti-Virus icon is the SB logo (you’ll see it later). 
- You would hold iPhone upside-down upon startup to startup the Spire OS. 
- The lock screen shows the "today" graph with limited info instead of always having to rely on a digital clock. Once you unlock your device, the limited today column will display all of your personal and work information (if you leave the calendar app open after unlocking it, that is). 
- Once you login to your device, it gathers all of your personal info from the server for you to use Spire. Or you can chose to start the OS in an offline mode and still see important info and use basic apps. 
- You would be able to access graph information from pretty much everywhere. Even on the [task bar/dock] will be ThumbTabs™ of this week that use icons that describe an event going on on a day.  
- ThrashPool™: the app to view notes, text messages, or just about anything text related in a single shot. In the pool tab, content boxes bleed through each other and you can select a text document (just like in GraphCalendar) and it tells you stuff about it and what app it's in. There is a default tab for "notes" already in this app, since it's technically the notes app. ThrashPool is also the search tool for the entire OS. 
- Spire would even show you system update times in a tab on your graph and even system update/error history info in the past for your convenience. 
- Most frequently used apps are shown bigger at the bottom of the screen and fly backwards (like the Star Wars intro) into smaller icons, representing the apps you use less.
